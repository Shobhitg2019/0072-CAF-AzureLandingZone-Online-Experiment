# Introduction 

This project is an experiment to deploy an IaaS based Online application to the online subscription of a Cloud Adoption Framework Azure Landing Zone using Terraform

# Project Objectives

This is really just an experiment for us which aims to establish a basic framework based on my current perception of Terraform best practices (Personally, I just started learning Terraform in December 2021, so as I learn of other or better best practices, our experiment here will evolve based on the principles of continuous improvement ('kaizen', 'kanban', and 'ikigai' for my Japanese or DevOps oriented readers!) ;-). For now, this project specifically addresses automating the provision of Azure resources using a scripted and CLI deployment approach with PowerShell (PowerShell Core, version 7.x) and Terraform.
# Getting Started

To start using this project, we recommend cloning it to your local system, review the the PowerShell script Set-TfWorkflow.ps1 and execute it to set up your Terraform directory structure, automate the provisioning of your backend state file in an Azure storage account and container, and set your logging environment variables for the log level and path.

# Test

Under construction.
